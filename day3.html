        Nature is the endless expanse of life forms, beauty, resources, peace and nourishment. Every bud that grows
            to a flower, every caterpillar that flies with the wings of a butterfly and every infant who faces the world
            as a human, owes its survival and sustenance to nature. In addition to providing resources for our daily
            needs of food, clothing and shelter, nature also contributes to different industries and manufacturing
            units. Paper, furniture, oil, gemstones, petrol, diesel, the fishing industry, electrical units, etc. all
            derive their basic components from nature.

            It can be said that nature drives the process of converting everything that is natural on earth into most of
            the things that are artificial. Nature also maintains the continuity between the different spheres on Earth.
            Owing to the multiple elements obtained from nature, with a growing population, the need to meet demands is
            increasing every day. At an equal pace is rising the level of air, water, soil and noise pollution as a
            result of the universal dependence on technology.

        Nature includes living and non-living components that together make life on Earth possible. Some forms of nature can be seen through the lush green forests, the vast sky above us, the oceans without an end, the mountains standing tall and so on. Nature nourishes the survival needs of plants, animals and humans alike. It provides the essential components of oxygen, sunlight, soil and water.

Several other products are obtained indirectly from nature which includes timber, paper, medicinal herbs, fibers, cotton, silk and various kinds of food. To fulfill the demand for these products, human beings have now engaged in the slaughter of trees and the destruction of nature. Different industries also poison nature with harmful gases and chemicals in addition to using excessive natural resources.
